It is an undocumented mess.
Good luck understanding the code if you want to tinker with it

I had less than a year of experience when I made this, that's why the code is very shitty. But I am still proud of it because it is my first GUI game

I kinda regret not making it orgranized as possible, because I couldn't do shit to optimize it anymore.
